My university coursework on Bias in AI.

```vision_manuscript.pdf``` discusses my opinions on the research paper "A Framework for Understanding Unintended Consequences of Machine Learning" by Suresh et al., which highlights how bias in machine learning is often treated too generically. I then go on to explore the future of bias in AI, emphasising the need for standardisation of bias technology.

In addition to this, I conducted a project to investigate machine learning bias (against younger applicants) in credit decisions, which uses the German Credit dataset. This work was inspired by Michael Feldman's research on fair machine learning.
